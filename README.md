## Description

"GamerZone" is a responsive landing page crafted solely with HTML and CSS. This project served as a graded assignment within the [Complete Web Development Course](https://web.programming-hero.com/course-details) offered by Programming Hero. The primary objective of this assignment was to assess our proficiency in developing responsive websites utilizing CSS queries effectively. Notably, the course provided the essential resources for constructing the website.

The task encompassed duplicating a Figma-designed website and recreating it's responsive counterpart. The end result was given a perfect score by the mentors.
